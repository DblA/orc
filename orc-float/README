See the notes about orc-pixel.

Specifying floating point parameters requires you to use the integer
that corresponds to the bit pattern of the floating point number you
want.

The SSE backend generates nearly correct output, however, it's not
bit exact with the C code for some operations.  Of course, it's
notoriously difficult to get bit-exact floating point code in C.
