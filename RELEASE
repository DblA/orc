0.4.5
=====

This release contains many small improvements related to
converting GStreamer from liboil to Orc.

The major addition in this release is the mainstreaming of
the NEON backend, made possible by Nokia.

There is a new experimental option to ./configure,
--enable-backend, which allows you to choose a single code
generation backend to include in the library.  This is mostly
useful for embedded systems, and is not recommended in general.

The upcoming release will focus on improving code generation
for the SSE and NEON backends.


0.4.4
=====

This is almost entirely a cleanup and bug fix release.

 - fix register copying on x86-64
 - better checking for partial test failures
 - fix documention build
 - fix build on many systems I don't personally use
 - various fixes to build/run on Win64 (Ramiro Polla)
 - add performance tests

Next release will merge in the new pixel compositing opcodes
and the SSE instruction scheduler.


0.4.3
=====

New opcodes: all the 32-bit float opcodes from the orc-float
library have been moved into the core library.

New opcodes: splitlw and splitwb, which are equivalent to
select0lw, select1lw, select0wb, and select1wb, except that
the new opcodes split a value into two destinations in one
opcode.

New backend: c64x-c, for the TI C64x+ DSP.  This backend only
produces source code, unlike other backends which can produce
both source and binary code.  Generating code for this backend
can be done using 'orcc --assembly --target=c64x-c'.

Orc now understands and can generate code for two-dimensional
arrays.  If the size of the array is known at compile time,
this information can be used to improve generated code.

Various improvements to the ARM backend by Wim Taymans.  The
ARM backend is still experimental.


0.4.2
=====

Bug fixes to C backend.  Turns out this is rather important on
CPUs that don't have a native backend.

New features have been postponed to 0.4.3.


0.4.1
=====

This release introduces the orcc program, which parses .orc files and
outputs C source files to compile into a library or application.  The
main source file implements the functions described by the .orc source
code, by creating Orc programs and compiling them at runtime.  Another
source file that it outputs is a test program that can be compiled and
run to determine if Orc is generating code correctly.  In future
releases, the orcc tool will be expanded to output assembly code, as
well as make it easier to use Orc in a variety of ways.

Much of Schroedinger and GStreamer have been converted to use Orc
instead of liboil, as well as converting code that wasn't able to
use liboil.  To enable this in Schroedinger, use the --enable-orc
configure option.  The GStreamer changes are in the orc branch in
the repository at http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~ds/gstreamer

Scheduled changes for 0.4.2 include a 2-D array mode for converting
the remaining liboil functions used in Schroedinger and GStreamer.


Major changes:

 - Add the orcc compiler.  Generates C code that creates Orc programs
   from .orc source files.
 - Improved testing
 - Fixes in the C backend
 - Fix the MMX backend to emit 'emms' instructions.
 - Add a few rules to the SSE backend.



0.4.0
